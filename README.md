# small_python_projects
Non-chronological practice from `The Big Book of Small Python Projects`<br>
by Al Sweigart.
<br>
<br>
The contents of this book can be found (at the time of writing),<br>
here: <https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/>
<br>
<br>
The goal of going through these mini-projects is to encounter<br>
interesting techniques and data structures for solving simple problems<br>
with Python.
<br>

## Notes on individual projects
<br>

## 1.Bagels
Was reminded that `main()` is just a function that can be called within itself, Ã  la recursion.
<br><br>

## 35.Hex_Grid
Learned that a tesselation requires minimal starting shapes.
<br><br>

## 3.Bitmap_Message
Re-learned the magical utility of the modulo operator, for repeating sequences<br>
of things.

I created a separate .py file to store the bitmap pattern, rather than store the<br> 
pattern inside the same py file as the general script.
<br><br>

## 12.Collatz_Sequence
Un-learned the now-automatic practice of first accumulating a string using a a list,<br>
then using .join() to make the string.You can instead print characters as you need them.

Learned what "flushing" output,to prevent it from being buffered, is.
<br><br>

## 12.DNA_Visualization
Learned that the `{}` delimeter of the `str.format()` method can be pre-defined<br>
in the string, then formatted later.
