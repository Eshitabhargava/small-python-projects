# small_python_projects
Non-chronological practice from `The Big Book of Small Python Projects`<br>
by Al Sweigart.
<br>
<br>
The contents of this book can be found (at the time of writing),<br>
here: <https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/>
<br>
<br>
The goal of going through these mini-projects is to encounter<br>
interesting techniques and data structures for solving simple problems<br>
with Python.

# Notes on individual projects
<br>

>## 1.Bagels
**Changes made**
1. Put code in functions to make it testable
2. Added pytest tests

**Learned**
1. `main()` is just a function that can be called withing itself, Ã  la recursion

<br>

>## 35.Hex_Grid
**Changes made**
1. Made the code testable by putting functionality in functions
2. Added pytest tests

**Learned**
1. A tesselation requires minimal starting shapes

<br>

>## 3.Bitmap_Message
**Changes made**
1. Created separate .py file to store bitmap patterns

**Learned**
1. The magical utility of the modulo operator, for repeating sequences of things

<br>

>## 12.Collatz_Sequence
**Learned**

1.You can only use `.join()` with lists of strings.

2.The concept of "flushing" output, to prevent it from being buffered.

3.You don't always have to accumulate what you are generating in a list first.
you can simply print it out as needed.
