# small_python_projects
Non-chronological practice from `The Big Book of Small Python Projects`<br>
by Al Sweigart.
<br>
<br>
The contents of this book can be found (at the time of writing),<br>
here: <https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/>
<br>
<br>
The goal of going through these mini-projects is to encounter<br>
interesting techniques and data structures for solving simple problems<br>
with Python.<br>
